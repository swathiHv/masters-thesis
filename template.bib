	abstract = {Regulation of metabolic operation in response to extracellular cues is crucial for cells{\textquoteright} survival. Next to the canonical nutrient sensors, which measure the concentration of nutrients, recently intracellular {\textquotedblleft}metabolic flux{\textquotedblright} was proposed as a novel impetus for metabolic regulation. According to this concept, cells would have molecular systems ({\textquotedblleft}flux sensors{\textquotedblright}) in place that regulate metabolism as a function of the actually occurring metabolic fluxes. Although this resembles an appealing concept, we have not had any experimental evidence for the existence of flux sensors and also we have not known how these flux sensors would work in detail. Here, we show experimental evidence that supports the hypothesis that Escherichia coli is indeed able to measure its glycolytic flux and uses this signal for metabolic regulation. Combining experiment and theory, we show how this flux-sensing function could emerge from an aggregate of several molecular mechanisms: First, the system of reactions of lower glycolysis and the feedforward activation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate on pyruvate kinase translate flux information into the concentration of the metabolite fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The interaction of this {\textquotedblleft}flux-signaling metabolite{\textquotedblright} with the transcription factor Cra then leads to flux-dependent regulation. By responding to glycolytic flux, rather than to the concentration of individual carbon sources, the cell may minimize sensing and regulatory expenses.},

Like its predecessors, the iJO1366 reconstruction is expected to be widely deployed for studying the systems biology of E. coli and for metabolic engineering applications.Mol Syst Biol. 7: 535},

Due to the successes with metabolism, there is an increasing effort to apply COBRA methods to reconstruct and analyze integrated models of cellular processes. The COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB is a leading software package for genome-scale analysis of metabolism; however, it was not designed to elegantly capture the complexity inherent in integrated biological networks and lacks an integration framework for the multiomics data used in systems biology.

    abstract = {Constraint-based models of metabolic networks are typically underdetermined, because they contain more reactions than metabolites. Therefore the solutions to this system do not consist of unique flux rates for each reaction, but rather a space of possible flux rates. By uniformly sampling this space, an estimated probability distribution for each reaction’s flux in the network can be obtained. However, sampling a high dimensional network is time-consuming. Furthermore, the constraints imposed on the network give rise to an irregularly shaped solution space. Therefore more tailored, efficient sampling methods are needed. We propose an efficient sampling algorithm (called optGpSampler), which implements the Artificial Centering Hit-and-Run algorithm in a different manner than the sampling algorithm implemented in the COBRA Toolbox for metabolic network analysis, here called gpSampler. Results of extensive experiments on different genome-scale metabolic networks show that optGpSampler is up to 40 times faster than gpSampler. Application of existing convergence diagnostics on small network reconstructions indicate that optGpSampler converges roughly ten times faster than gpSampler towards similar sampling distributions. For networks of higher dimension (i.e. containing more than 500 reactions), we observed significantly better convergence of optGpSampler and a large deviation between the samples generated by the two algorithms. Availability: optGpSampler for Matlab and Python is available for non-commercial use at: http://cs.ru.nl/~wmegchel/optGpSampler/.},

abstract ={The human mitochondrial metabolic network was recently reconstructed based on proteomic and biochemical data. Linear programming and uniform random sampling were applied herein to identify candidate steady states of the metabolic network that were consistent with the imposed physico-chemical constraints and available experimental data. The activity of the mitochondrion was studied under four metabolic conditions: normal physiologic, diabetic, ischemic, and dietetic. Pairwise correlations between steady-state reaction fluxes were calculated in each condition to evaluate the dependence among the reactions in the network. Applying constraints on exchange fluxes resulted in predictions for intracellular fluxes that agreed with experimental data. Analyses of the steady-state flux distributions showed that the experimentally observed reduced activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase in vivo could be a result of stoichiometric constraints and therefore would not necessarily require enzymatic inhibition. The observed changes in the energy metabolism of the mitochondrion under diabetic conditions were used to evaluate the impact of previously suggested treatments. The results showed that neither normalized glucose uptake nor decreased ketone body uptake have a positive effect on the mitochondrial energy metabolism or network flexibility. Taken together, this study showed that sampling of the steady-state flux space is a powerful method to investigate network properties under different conditions and provides a basis for in silico evaluations of effects of potential disease treatments.},

To facilitate such approaches, we present Escher, a web application that can be used to rapidly build pathway maps. On Escher maps, diverse datasets related to genes, reactions, and metabolites can be quickly contextualized within metabolism and, increasingly, beyond metabolism.

These two competing objectives have been shown, both computationally and experimentally, to exist as the principal dimensions of the function of metabolic networks. Each of these dimensions can also be thought of as the familiar metabolic functions of catabolism, anabolism, and generation of energy. Here we detail how two global transcription factors (TFs), ArcA and Fnr of Escherichia coli that sense redox ratios, act on a genome-wide basis to coordinately regulate these global metabolic functions through transcriptional control of enzyme and transporter levels in changing environments. A model results from the study that shows how global transcription factors regulate global dimensions of metabolism and form a regulatory hierarchy that reflects the structural hierarchy of the metabolic network.},

This model reproduces E. coli's known physiological behavior. We found that the interplay of known interactions in E. coli's central metabolism can indirectly recognize the presence of extracellular carbon sources through measuring intracellular metabolic flux patterns. We found that E. coli's system-level adaptations between glycolytic and gluconeogenic carbon sources are realized on the molecular level by global feedback architectures that overarch the enzymatic and transcriptional regulatory layers. We found that the capability for closed-loop self-regulation can emerge within metabolism itself and therefore, metabolic operation may adapt itself autonomously to changing carbon sources (not requiring upstream sensing and signaling).},

abstract={A single gene mutant lacking phosphoglucose isomerase (pgi) was selected after ethyl methane sulfonate mutagenesis of Escherichia coli strain K-10. Enzyme assays revealed no pgi activity in the mutant, whereas levels of glucokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and gluconate-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were similar in parent and mutant. The amount of glucose released by acid hydrolysis of the mutant cells after growth on gluconate was less than 2\% that released from parent cells; when grown in the presence of glucose, mutant and parent cells contained the same amount of glucose residues. The mutant grew on glucose one-third as fast as the parent; it also grew much slower than the parent on galactose, maltose, and lactose. On fructose, gluconate, and other carbon sources, growth was almost normal. In both parent and mutant, gluconokinase and gluconate-6-phosphate dehydrase were present during growth on gluconate but not during growth on glucose. Assay and degradation of alanine from protein hydrolysates after growth on glucose-1-(14)C and gluconate-1-(14)C showed that in the parent strain glucose was metabolized by the glycolytic path and the hexose monophosphate shunt. Gluconate was metabolized by the Entner-Doudoroff path and the hexose monophosphate shunt. The mutant used glucose chiefly by the shunt, but may also have used the Entner-Doudoroff path to a limited extent.},

This reconstructed regulatory network coupled with an existing genome-scale metabolic network model allows in silico prediction of growth phenotypes of regulatory gene deletions as well as gene expression profiles. We compared model predictions of gene expression changes in response to genetic and environmental perturbations to experimental data to identify potential novel targets for transcription factors. We then identified regulatory cascades connecting transcription factors to the potential targets through a systematic model expansion strategy using published genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and binding-site-motif data sets. Finally, we show the ability of an integrated metabolic and regulatory network model to predict growth phenotypes of transcription factor knockout strains.

abstract = "Genome-scale metabolic networks can now be reconstructed based on annotated genomic data augmented with biochemical and physiological information about the organism. Mathematical analysis can be performed to assess the capabilities of these reconstructed networks. The constraints-based framework, with flux balance analysis (FBA), has been used successfully to predict time course of growth and by-product secretion, effects of mutation and knock-outs, and gene expression profiles. However, FBA leads to incorrect predictions in situations where regulatory effects are a dominant influence on the behavior of the organism. Thus, there is a need to include regulatory events within FBA to broaden its scope and predictive capabilities. Here we represent transcriptional regulatory events as time-dependent constraints on the capabilities of a reconstructed metabolic network to further constrain the space of possible network functions. Using a simplified metabolic/regulatory network, growth is simulated under various conditions to illustrate systemic effects such as catabolite repression, the aerobic/anaerobic diauxic shift and amino acid biosynthesis pathway repression. The incorporation of transcriptional regulatory events in FBA enables us to interpret, analyse and predict the effects of transcriptional regulation on cellular metabolism at the systemic level."

abstract={This paper presents a new method, steady-state regulatory flux balance analysis (SR-FBA), for predicting gene expression and metabolic fluxes in a large-scale integrated metabolic-regulatory model. Using SR-FBA to study the metabolism of Escherichia coli, we quantify the extent to which the different levels of metabolic and transcriptional regulatory constraints determine metabolic behavior: metabolic constraints determine the flux activity state of 45-51\% of metabolic genes, depending on the growth media, whereas transcription regulation determines the flux activity state of 13-20\% of the genes. A considerable number of 36 genes are redundantly expressed, that is, they are expressed even though the fluxes of their associated reactions are zero, indicating that they are not optimally tuned for cellular flux demands. The undetermined state of the remaining {\textasciitilde}30\% of the genes suggests that they may represent metabolic variability within a given growth medium. Overall, SR-FBA enables one to address a host of new questions concerning the interplay between regulation and metabolism.},

    abstract = {Author SummaryCellular systems comprise many diverse components and component interactions spanning signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and metabolism. Although signaling, metabolic, and regulatory activities are often investigated independently of one another, there is growing evidence that considerable interplay occurs among them, and that the malfunctioning of this interplay is associated with disease. The computational analysis of integrated networks has been challenging because of the varying time scales involved as well as the sheer magnitude of such systems (e.g., the numbers of rate constants involved). To this end, we developed a novel computational framework called integrated dynamic flux balance analysis (idFBA) that generates quantitative, dynamic predictions of species concentrations spanning signaling, regulatory, and metabolic processes. idFBA extends an existing approach called flux balance analysis (FBA) in that it couples “fast” and “slow” reactions, thereby facilitating the study of whole-cell phenotypes and not just sub-cellular network properties. We applied this framework to a prototypic integrated system derived from literature as well as a representative integrated yeast module (the high-osmolarity glycerol [HOG] pathway) and generated time-course predictions that matched with available experimental data. By extending this framework to larger-scale systems, phenotypic profiles of whole-cell systems could be attained expeditiously.},

In this paper, we develop a framework called Integrated Deduced REgulation And Metabolism (IDREAM) that can improve our ability to predict phenotypes of microorganisms, and particularly it can address the challenges in evaluating phenotypic consequence of perturbing transcriptional regulation of metabolism in a eukaryotic cell. We compare the predictive performance of an IDREAM S. cerevisiae model with a PROM model using a TRN available from the YEASTRACT database. IDREAM outperforms PROM using any of three popular yeast metabolic models and across three experimental growth conditions, making it possible to identify subtle synthetic growth defects, and a new role for Oaf1 in the regulation of acetyl-CoA biosynthesis.},

	abstract = {Prediction of metabolic changes that result from genetic or environmental perturbations has several important applications, including diagnosing metabolic disorders and discovering novel drug targets. A cardinal challenge in obtaining accurate predictions is the integration of transcriptional regulatory networks with the corresponding metabolic network. We propose a method called probabilistic regulation of metabolism (PROM) that achieves this synthesis and enables straightforward, automated, and quantitative integration of high-throughput data into constraint-based modeling, making it an ideal tool for constructing genome-scale regulatory-metabolic network models for less-studied organisms. PROM introduces probabilities to represent gene states and gene{\textendash}transcription factor interactions. By using PROM, we constructed an integrated regulatory-metabolic network for the model organism, Escherichia coli, and demonstrated that our method based on automated inference is more accurate and comprehensive than the current state of the art, which is based on manual curation of literature. After validating the approach, we used PROM to build a genome-scale integrated metabolic-regulatory model for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a critically important human pathogen. This study incorporated data from more than 1,300 microarrays, 2,000 transcription factor{\textendash}target interactions regulating 3,300 metabolic reactions, and 1,905 KO phenotypes for E. coli and M. tuberculosis. PROM identified KO phenotypes with accuracies as high as 95\%, and predicted growth rates quantitatively with correlation of 0.95. Importantly, PROM represents the successful integration of a top-down reconstructed, statistically inferred regulatory network with a bottom-up reconstructed, biochemically detailed metabolic network, bridging two important classes of systems biology models that are rarely combined quantitatively.},

ABSTRACT={In the face of changes in their environment, bacteria adjust gene expression and produce an appropriate response. The individual layers of this process have been widely studied: the Transcriptional Regulatory Network describes the regulatory interactions that produce changes in the Metabolic Network, both coordinated by the Signaling Network; but the interplay between them has never been described in a systematic fashion. Here, we formalize the process of detection and processing of environmental information mediated by individual transcription factors in a concept termed Genetic Sensory Response Unit (GENSOR Unit), composed of four components: 1) signal, 2) signal transduction, 3) genetic switch, and 4) response. We used experimentally validated datasets from two databases to assemble a GENSOR Unit for each of the 189 local Transcription factors of Escherichia coli K-12 present in RegulonDB. Further analysis suggested that feedback is a common occurrence in signal processing and showed a gradient of functional complexity in the response mediated by each Transcription factor, as opposed to a one regulator-one pathway rule. Finally, we provide examples of other GENSOR Unit applications such as hypothesis generation, detailed description of cellular decision-making and elucidation of indirect regulatory mechanisms.}
