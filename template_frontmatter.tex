%% DEDICATION
%
%  You have three choices here:
%    1. Use the ``dedication'' environment.
%       Put in the text you want, and everything will be formated for
%       you. You'll get a perfectly respectable dedication page.
%
%
%    2. Use the ``mydedication'' environment.  If you don't like the
%       formatting of option 1, use this environment and format things
%       however you wish.
%
%    3. If you don't want a dedication, it's not required.
%
%
\begin{dedication}
%  To two, the loneliest number since the number one.
To my Mom, Dad, Grandparents and Sister.\\ I am what I am because of you!

\begin{abstract}
 Knowing how a microbe senses input and dials a response is important for metabolic engineers trying to direct microbial resources and reactions to specific pathways. Prediction of metabolic changes that result from genetic or environmental perturbations has several important applications, including diagnosing metabolic disorders and discovering novel drug targets. Most of the research in the field of metabolic modeling, focuses on integrating metabolic networks with additional data like transcriptional or genomic data. 
  
Microbial cells consist of flux sensors which measure the rate at which certain metabolic changes like enzymatic reactions takes place, and then adjust, or dial, certain reactions and pathway flux. We hypothesize that these flux \textbf{sensors provide enough information to predict the change in dial values } i.e flux splits between different pathways. This project aims to prove the above-mentioned hypothesis using statistical modeling of sensors and dials data. 
  
Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling methods, we sample the flux states of the Escherichia coli MG1566 strain under varying nutrient sources. We sample from 34 conditions across multiple BiGG models to create a dataset with 340000 datapoints. We then apply statistical modeling techniques like linear regression, decision trees and ensemble learning methods to predict the dial values using sensor values as input. The results from the statistical modeling techniques show that sensors can effectively predict the dial values without the need for additional data like transcriptional or genomic data.
